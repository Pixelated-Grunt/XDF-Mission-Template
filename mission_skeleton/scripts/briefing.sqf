If it is a VC BHQ, the position is likely to be garrisoned by a Platoon plus ( including
HQ staff) . The position is likely to be defended lightly but in depth, with security
patrols operating 1 â€“ 2 Km out, sentry posts 50 - 100 M out, and bunker positions
on the perimeter of the position. The position is also likely to have early warning
devices and possibly booby traps on likely approaches."]];
